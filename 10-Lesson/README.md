# Subqueries

#### A subquery is a SQL query nested inside a larger query.

A subquery can occur in:

1. A SELECT clause
2. A FROM clause
3. A WHERE clause

- A subquery can be nested inside a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statements, or inside another subquery.

- We can use comparison operators - > , <, =. or - IN, ANY, ALL.

- A subquery is also called - inner query.
- The inner query (subquery) is executed first before the parent query so that the results of an inner query can be passed to the parent query.
